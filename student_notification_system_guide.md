# Student Notification System - Implementation Guide

## ✅ **What's Been Implemented**

The Student Management section now has a comprehensive notification system that stores notifications in the `users` table instead of `student_data`.

### **🔧 Key Features:**

✅ **Send to Selected Students**: Choose specific students and send targeted notifications  
✅ **Send to All Students**: Broadcast notifications to all students at once  
✅ **Multiple Notification Types**: 12 predefined notification options  
✅ **User Table Integration**: Notifications stored in `users.notifications` JSONB column  
✅ **Email Mapping**: Automatically maps student data to user accounts via email

### **📱 Notification Types Available:**

1. New Event Available
2. Join New Club - Registration Open
3. Exam Schedule Released
4. Holiday Announcement
5. Academic Calendar Update
6. Important Deadline Reminder
7. Course Registration Open
8. Library Hours Changed
9. Campus Facility Update
10. Student Services Announcement
11. Scholarship Opportunity
12. Career Fair Announcement

### **🗄️ Database Structure:**

The notifications are stored in the `users` table with this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "1704067200000",
  "title": "Student Management Notification",
  "message": "New Event Available",
  "type": "info",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "read": false
}
```

### **🔄 How It Works:**

1. **Admin selects notification type** from dropdown
2. **Admin chooses recipients**:
   - Select individual students using checkboxes
   - OR send to all students
3. **System processes the request**:
   - Gets selected students from `student_data` table
   - Maps student emails to user accounts in `users` table
   - Creates notification object with timestamp
   - Appends to existing notifications array
4. **Students receive notifications** in their profile page

### **📋 Setup Instructions:**

1. **Run the SQL script**: Execute `add_notifications_to_users.sql` to add the notifications column to your users table
2. **Access the feature**: Go to Admin Dashboard → Students tab
3. **Send notifications**: Use the notification section in the Student Management interface

### **🎯 Usage:**

**For Selected Students:**

1. Check the boxes next to specific students
2. Select a notification type from dropdown
3. Click "Send to Selected"

**For All Students:**

1. Select a notification type from dropdown
2. Click "Send to All" (no student selection needed)
